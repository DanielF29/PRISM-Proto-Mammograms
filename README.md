# PRISM-Proto-Mammograms

PRISM: a prototypical case-based learning approach for interpretable BI-RADS mammogram interpretation 

The primary goal of this project is to develop an automated tool that utilizes a deep learning algorithm to classify the four levels of BI-RADS, thereby aiding radiologists in making final decisions.
while retaining the specialist's accountability by providing explanations of the recommended BI-RADS given by the model.
The method is based on automatic prototypical part learning, particularly a Deep Learning approach with a case-based reasoning foundation behind its generated explanations of suggested BI-RADS classification of mammograms.
